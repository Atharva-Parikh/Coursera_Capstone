# Predict severity of Accident using Seattle accident data
The Seattle government is going to prevent avoidable car accidents by employing methods that alert drivers, health system, and police to remind them to be more careful in critical situations.  
The main reasons for car accidents are:-
  - _Distracted Driving.
  - _Speeding._
  - _Drunk Driving._
  - _Reckless Driving._
  - _Rain etc._
  
Whilst some of these factors are human dependent, others can be predicted by revealing hidden patterns within data. We can provide warnings according to the patterns we find and thus attempt to save as much lives as possible.
The target audience of the project is local Seattle government, police, rescue groups, and last but not least, car insurance institutes. The model and its results are going to provide some advice for the target audience to make insightful decisions for reducing the number of accidents and injuries for the city.
